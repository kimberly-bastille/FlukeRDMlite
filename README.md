# FlukeRDMlite

This is the basic frontend for the RShiny RDM tool app.  See https://github.com/kimberly-bastille/ for the full repository.

We intend to host this on NOAA Fisheries Connect. Stakeholders will use the app to develop sets of regulations. 

The front end will do two things
1. Shows the results of previously run regulations.
2. Saves user created regulations to a place where we can later access, validate them, and submit them to the NEFSC container.
