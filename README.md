# FlukeRDMlite

This is the basic frontend for the RShiny RDM tool app.  

We intend to host this on NOAA Fisheries Connect. Stakeholders will use the app to develop sets of regulations. 

The front end will simply save the regulations to a place where we can later access them, validate them, and submit them to the NEFSC container.
